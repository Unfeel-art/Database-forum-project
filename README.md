## Course Information

## Project Overview

Our web application serves as a forum platform, providing an online space where people can connect, share ideas, and engage in discussions. Much like traditional message boards, conversations take place through posts, which can be organized into threads under different categories. Users can contribute by starting new threads, replying to ongoing discussions, and building conversations that evolve over time. The posts can contain text or images. Users will also have a dedicated profile page, which they can customize. Users are divided into two groups: regular users and moderators. Additionally, they can react to posts and report them to authorized moderators. The moderators can delete or suspend posts based on report feedback. The main page will display categories and recent or popular posts. You can navigate through these categories to explore relevant topics.
